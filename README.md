# YoutubeVideoSearch
An app, written in Python, that lets you search videos on YouTube by entering a key word. Works the same way as the search bar of the website. Made for fun.

In order to make the code work, you must first have all the necessary modules installed. In case your Python version doesn't have it installed, please go to the Terminal and enter:

> pip3 install webbrowser
